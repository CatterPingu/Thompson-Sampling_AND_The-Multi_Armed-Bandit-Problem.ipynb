# Thompson-Sampling_AND_The-Multi_Armed-Bandit-Problem.ipynb

This project aims to maximize the chances of winning while playing multiple slot machines with fixed cash using the Thompson Sampling algorithm. The problem statement requires finding the best slot machine to play among multiple options to increase the chances of winning.

The project uses Python and the NumPy library for creating the slot machines and implementing the Thompson Sampling algorithm. The code initializes the cash, the number of turns, and the number of slot machines. It also generates conversion rates for each slot machine and creates a 2D array for wins and losses.

The Thompson Sampling algorithm is then implemented to find the best slot machine to play. For each turn, the algorithm chooses the slot machine with the highest beta value. The beta values are calculated using the number of positive and negative rewards for each slot machine. The code then records the wins and losses and determines the best slot machine to play based on the number of times each machine was played.

The project compares the Thompson Sampling approach with a naive random sampling approach to determine the total number of wins. The code outputs the total number of wins with Thompson Sampling and random sampling to compare the effectiveness of both approaches.

Overall, this project presents a practical application of the Thompson Sampling algorithm to solve a real-world problem of maximizing the chances of winning while playing multiple slot machines.
